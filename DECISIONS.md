## D-W0-ORIGIN (2026-09-12) — GitHub is lab origin until GitLab CE exists

**Decision:** `origin` of this repo is **GitHub** (account `wozniaknorbert95-del`). GitLab CE self-hosted remains the **target** origin from handbook D1 (07.09.2026), not the current fact.

**Why:** Installing GitLab CE (HTTPS, 2FA, signup OFF, runner, hello pipeline, backup) is a Commander human-stop (VPS, Zasada 11). Staff must not guess Cloud Agents against an unproven CE. Handbook v3.1 allows this exit: *GitHub-origin in DECISIONS.md*.

**Forbidden:** two remotes pushing the same lab (`origin` GitHub + GitLab). Dual-origin is a lie about SoT.

**When CE is proven** (`docs/W0-GITLAB-CE-CHECKLIST.md` all boxes + hello CI green on *our* runner): add D-W0-CE-CUTOVER here, change *only then* `origin` to GitLab, leave GitHub as Cloud Agents plan B **copy** (not dual-push).

**Cloud Agents today:** official GitHub integration. CE token test (handbook `05` §5) waits for cutover day.

## D-STACK (2026-09-12) — Node 20, npm, zero extra deps

Lab is a loop trainer, not a product clone of dsaas-platform. Commands in `AGENTS.md` = CI = `package.json` scripts. No pnpm, no TypeScript, no dsaas canon copy.

## D-C7 (2026-09-12) — this repo is never dsaas

Do not implement QuietForge / ENT-* / Kokpit here. Do not paste `dsaas-platform-main/AGENTS.md` into this file. Platform work stays on GitHub repo `dsaas-platform-main`.
